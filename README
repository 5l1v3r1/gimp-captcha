 gimp-captcha
===============
gimp-captcha is a program for generating difficult to break captchas, by
scripting Gimp via Python.

INSTALLATION & USAGE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There isn't really a way to install yet::

    git clone https://github.com/isislovecruft/gimp-captcha.git
    cd gimp-captcha
    ./make-captchas --help

STATUS
~~~~~~
The script is written to generate captchas in batches, as even on a fast
system it isn't usually desirable to fire up a whole gimp instance to
generate a single captcha.

gimp-captcha has been tested and runs in production with gimp-2.8 on
Debian-derived systems.
