gimp-captcha is a program for generating difficult to break captchas
using the gimp.

The script is written to generate captchas in batches, as even on a fast
system it isn't usually desirable to fire up a whole gimp instance to
generate a single captcha.

See the docstring in captcha.py for setup instructions.

STATUS

gimp-captcha has been tested and runs in production with gimp 2.2 on Ubuntu
Edgy.  

As of 1.0.2, it is compatible with gimp 2.4 as well.

AUTHOR

gimp-captcha was originally created by Darrin Thompson for SpiderOak.
